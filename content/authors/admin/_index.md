Leonardo "Leo" David Salgado was born in Honduras, Central America. He got his bachelor's degree in Agricultural Sciences at Universidad Nacional de Agricultura (UNAG), which led him to an internship working on sugarcane and rice integrated pest management under the supervision of Dr. Blake Wilson at Louisiana State University (LSU). After graduating, Leo joined the Wilson Lab to pursue a master's degree in Entomology with a minor in applied statistics. While at LSU, Leo was the president and a founding member of "UNAs at LSU," which is a student association that connects UNAG students and graduates with LSU AgCenter faculty members to gain international experience in agricultural research. Leo and his colleagues successfully connected ten Honduran students with LSU faculty, and six students started graduate programs at LSU. 

Currently, Leo is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Entomology at Cornell University under the direction of Dr. Brian Nault. Leo's projects involve: 1) determining the onion maggot and seedcorn maggot composition early in the season when onions are most vulnerable to maggot attack across multiple onion production regions, 2) comparing the efficacy of various insecticide seed treatments of onions in the field, 3) assessing onion maggot susceptibility to seed treatment insecticide active ingredients by laboratory bioassays, and 4) determining the genetic structure of maggot species in onion fields from production regions that differ in size and investigating if resistance to insecticides in maggot populations could be influenced by geography and/or size of production area.
