abstract: "The sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae),
  is the primary pest of sugarcane, Saccharum spp., in much of North and South
  America. Control of D. saccharalis can be obtained through judicious
  application of insecticides, but more research is needed to optimize chemical
  control strategies. A series of field trials evaluated the duration of
  protection and influence of application water volume on D. saccharalis control
  in Louisiana sugarcane from 2018 to 2020. Results across trials demonstrated
  superior control was achieved with chlorantraniliprole over novaluron and
  tebufenozide. Analysis of insecticide concentrations present in leaf sheath
  tissue of the target internode suggests chlorantraniliprole and novaluron are
  achieving systemic activity, but not tebufenozide. Chlorantraniliprole
  concentrations remained above lethal levels for more than 8 wk after
  application. The percentage of bored internodes was 1.3- and 1.9-fold greater
  following applications with a water volume of 18.7 L/ha relative to those made
  with 46.7 and 186.8 L/ha, respectively, across insecticides. Collectively,
  results suggest chlorantraniliprole applied early in the season with
  sufficient water volume can provide nearly season-long protection of sugarcane
  against D. saccharalis injury."

  Highlights

  • Chlorantraniliprole and novaluron are systemic in sugarcane.

  • Chlorantraniliprole provides up to eight weeks of protection from Diatraea saccharalis injury in sugarcane.

  • Efficacy of insecticide applications in sugarcane is reduced at low water volumes.
