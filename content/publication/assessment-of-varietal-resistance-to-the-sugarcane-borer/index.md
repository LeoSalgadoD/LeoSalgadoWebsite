  Significant differences in the percentage of bored internodes and relative
  resistance ratio

  among the varieties were detected, with HoCP 00-950 (21.37% bored internodes) and L 12-201

  (20.81%) being the most susceptible cultivars. The cultivar HoCP 13-740 had the highest value

  of emergence per stalk (0.58 adults per stalk) and the highest survival ratio (0.15 adults per bored

  internode). The use of the relative resistance ratio classified cultivars in one highly resistant

  cultivar (HoCP 85-845) in three resistant cultivars (L 01-299, HoCP 04-838, and Ho 11-573), in

  five intermediate resistant cultivars (Ho 12-615, HoCP 96-540, HoCP 13-758, L 01-283 and Ho

  13-708) and seven susceptible cultivars (Ho 13-739, HoCP 09-804, L 12-201, L 11-183, L 13-

  251, HoCP 00-950 and HoCP 13-740). Results from this study will be included in considerations

  of cultivar releases and cultivar-specific SCB management tactics.
