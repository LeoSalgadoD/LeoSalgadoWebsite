abstract: Cultivar resistance is a key management strategy for the sugarcane
  borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), the primary pest in Louisiana sugarcane, but
  mechanisms of resistance are not well understood. This research evaluated the
  potential mechanisms of cultivar resistance to D. saccharalis among
  commercially produced sugarcane cultivars and experimental lines through three
  field screenings, two greenhouse experiments, and one diet incorporation
  assay. The resistant standards HoCP 85-845, HoCP 04-838, and L 01-299 were
  among the cultivars with the lowest D. saccharalis injury levels in both field
  and greenhouse trials. Cultivars HoCP 00-950 and L 12-201 were among the most
  heavily injured in both trials. Differences in oviposition among cultivars in
  the greenhouse choice study were not detected, suggesting adult preference is
  not a key factor in resistance. This was also supported by the no-choice
  greenhouse experiment in which up to 9-fold differences in neonate
  establishment among cultivars were detected. Larval injury among cultivars in
  greenhouse experiments was consistent with field studies suggesting traits
  that affect neonate establishment (e.g., rind hardness) help to confer
  resistance in the field. In the diet incorporation assay, lower larval weights
  and longer time to pupation were observed on resistant cultivar Ho 08-9003,
  but no differences were found among current commercial cultivars. Continuous
  evaluation of cultivar resistance to D. saccharalis is important in developing
  effective integrated pest management strategies for this pest. More research
  into plant characteristics (e.g., leaf sheath tightness and pubescence)
  associated with resistance is needed.

  This research evaluated the potential mechanisms of cultivar resistance to D. saccharalis among commercially produced sugarcane cultivars and experimental lines through three field screenings, two greenhouse experiments, and one diet incorporation assay.
