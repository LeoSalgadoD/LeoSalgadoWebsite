UNAs at LSU Association was created as a result of the LSU AgCenter-UNAG internship program initiated in 2012. UNAs at LSU has been established for the purpose of broadening the scientific background of members and to better prepare them for their career.

Founding member of “UNAs at LSU,” which is a student association that helps to connect an LSU AgCenter faculty member to UNA students and graduates to allow them to gain international experience in agricultural research and to pursue post-graduate education at LSU. During my period as president we connected ten people from Honduras to LSU AgCenter Faculty, and 4 of them have become graduate students at LSU.
