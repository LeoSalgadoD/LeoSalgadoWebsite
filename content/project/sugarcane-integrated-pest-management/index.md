The most important insect pests of sugarcane in the United States are the stem borer complex, formed by two species of the family Crambidae (Lepidoptera). Historically, the primary pest has been the sugarcane borer (*Diatraea saccharalis* F.), and the emerging threat is the invasive Mexican rice borer (*Eoreuma loftini* Dyar). 

Management of stem borers in sugarcane relies on integrated pest management (IPM) involving a balance of multiple control tactics. Advances in IPM practices made over the last several decades have helped Louisiana sugarcane farmers reduce reliance on insecticide applications. 

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of new insecticides classes.  However, the potential development of insecticide resistance and the failure of natural enemies to establish in Louisiana’s sugarcane crop due to factors such as annual winter freezes, crop harvest at nine months, and other natural enemies’ interference have urged the need for different control tactics.
