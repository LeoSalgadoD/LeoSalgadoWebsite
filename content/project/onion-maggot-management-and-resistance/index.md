Onion maggot (*Delia antiqua*) and seedcorn maggot (*D. platura*) attack allium crops throughout the northern onion production areas in the US and across the world but differ in abundance and pest status in each region. Larvae of these pests attack crops by feeding on plant roots and destroying bulbs, causing losses up to 60% in heavy infestations.


Management of these pests has primarily relied on chemical control and cultural practices.
